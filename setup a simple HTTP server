/**
  Using PHP: 
  For Mac OS or linux users, your operating system usually has PHP installed so 
  You do not have to install it. For windows users, you will need to install PHP 
  Since it is not available by default. After having PHP installed, you first 
  Open your command line or terminal and navigate to your project directory by 
  Using "cd" command. Afterwards, you run this command: "php -S localhost:8000" 
  And it should say "Listening on http://localhost:8000". By running this 
  Command you can open your project from your browser using this address: 
  "http://localhost:8000".

  Using Node.js: 
  You will be using it for upcoming tutorials and you can use it to work on your 
  Second assignment, so installing Nodejs can serve other purposes. They provide 
  A UI installer so it is easy to install, you can go to this link: 
  https://nodejs.org/en/download/. After installing Node.js, open your terminal 
  (mac/linux) or command prompt (windows) and run this command: 
  "npm install http-server -g" (put sudo before npm if you are mac/linux users). 
  If http-server installation is complete, go to your project directory by using 
  "cd" command and run command "http-server". It will provide you url(s) to access 
  Your project from your browser, you usually can access your project from this 
  address: "http://127.0.0.1:8080".
